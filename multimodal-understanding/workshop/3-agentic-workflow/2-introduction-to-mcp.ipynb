    "# Anyco Telecom Customer Support Agent with MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build a comprehensive customer support agent for Anyco Telecom, a cellular service provider. This agent will help customer service representatives quickly access customer information, billing details, usage statistics, and resolve common customer inquiries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We're Building\n",
    "\n",
    "Our customer support agent will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Customer Account Lookup**: Find customers by phone or email, get complete profiles\n",
    "2. **Billing & Invoices**: Check current bills, payment history, overdue amounts\n",
    "3. **Service Plans & Usage**: View current plans, data usage, overage charges\n",
    "4. **Add-ons & Features**: List active add-ons and available options\n",
    "5. **Account Troubleshooting**: Check suspension status, recent account changes\n",
    "6. **Payment Methods**: View and validate payment information\n",
    "7. **Family Plans**: Manage multi-line accounts and calculate total costs\n",
    "8. **Agent Tools**: Find high-usage customers, overdue accounts, loyalty opportunities\n",
    "\n",
    "## MCP Architecture Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Model Context Provider (MCP) pattern allows us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Separate Database Logic**: All SQL queries and database connections are handled by the MCP server\n",
    "- **Reusable Tools**: The same tools can be used by multiple agents or applications\n",
    "- **Scalable**: Easy to add new customer support tools without changing agent code\n",
    "- **Maintainable**: Database schema changes only require updating the MCP server\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strands SDK with MCP Server Architecture\n",
    "Note how we've now moved all tool definitions into our FastMCP server. We'll see how Strands SDK seamlessly integrates with this server using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n",

    "- When a customer provides their phone number or email, use the available tools directly with that information\n",
    "- Most tools accept either 'phone' or 'email' parameters - pass whichever one the customer provided\n",
    "- You can use find_customer_by_phone or find_customer_by_email to verify customer identity\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've built a comprehensive customer support agent for Anyco Telecom using the Model Context Provider (MCP) architecture. Our implementation demonstrates several key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Complete Customer Support Coverage**: Our agent can handle the full spectrum of customer inquiries from basic account lookups to complex billing investigations\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Database Integration**: All customer data is accessed through secure, parameterized SQL queries that prevent injection attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Intelligent Tool Selection**: The agent automatically chooses the right combination of tools based on customer needs\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Professional Communication**: Responses are formatted appropriately for customer service representatives\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analytics and Insights**: Built-in tools help identify business opportunities and manage workload priorities\n",
    "\n",
    "## MCP Architecture Benefits for Customer Support\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Database queries are separated from agent logic, making maintenance easier\n",
    "- **Reusability**: The same MCP server can power multiple customer support applications\n",
    "- **Scalability**: New customer support tools can be added without changing agent code\n",
    "- **Security**: Database credentials and connection logic are isolated in the MCP server\n",
    "- **Consistency**: All agents use the same data access patterns and business logic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture is ideal for:\n",
    "- **Call Center Operations**: Agents can quickly access comprehensive customer information\n",
    "- **Self-Service Portals**: Customers can get instant answers to common questions\n",
    "- **Mobile Support Apps**: Field technicians can access customer data on mobile devices\n",
    "- **Business Intelligence**: Management can analyze customer patterns and support metrics\n",
    "- **Training Systems**: New representatives can practice with realistic customer scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "The MCP pattern provides a robust foundation for building sophisticated customer support systems that can evolve with business needs while maintaining consistency and reliability."
