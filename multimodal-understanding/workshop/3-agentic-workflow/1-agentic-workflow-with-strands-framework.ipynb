    "# Building Agentic Workflows with Strands Agents SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing [Strands Agents](https://github.com/strands-agents/sdk-python), an Open Source AI Agents SDK! This is a simple-to-use, code-first framework that takes a model-driven approach to building and running AI agents in just a few lines of code, scaling from simple to complex use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core of Strands is a simple agentic loop that connects the model and tools together, like two strands of DNA. It's already powering production AI agents in key AWS services like Amazon Q CLI, AWS Glue, and VPC Reachability Analyzer. It includes 20+ built-in tools with support for thousands of Model Context Provider (MCP) servers. AWS is excited that Accenture, Anthropic, Meta, and others are joining with support and contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case\n",
    "In this lab, we will create a customer support agent using the Strands SDK. This is inspired by enterprise use cases we've helped build directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our customer support agent will be interacting with a relational database of synthesized customer data for Anyco Telecom. We'll start first by building an agent using only the Strands SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we'll take a look at what an MCP implementation would look like by moving our tools to a local FastMCP server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, we'll deploy our agent to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime and integrate use of AgentCore memory - a must have for any truly helpful customer support agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we've successfully built and tested a restaurant booking agent using the Strands Agents SDK. Let's summarize what we've learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Accomplishments\n",
    "1. **Agent Creation**: We created a functional AI agent that understands natural language requests and can perform booking operations\n",
    "2. **Tool Integration**: We implemented and integrated several custom tools for managing restaurant bookings:\n",
    "   - Creating new reservations\n",
    "   - Retrieving booking details\n",
    "   - Cancelling reservations\n",
    "3. **State Management**: We observed how Strands maintains conversation context across multiple interactions\n",
    "4. **Metrics Analysis**: We examined performance metrics that help optimize agent behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The Strands Agents SDK provides a powerful, flexible foundation for building intelligent agents that can handle complex workflows while maintaining contextual awareness.
