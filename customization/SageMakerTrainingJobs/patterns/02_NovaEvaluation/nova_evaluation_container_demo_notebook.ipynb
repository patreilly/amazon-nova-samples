    "# Nova evaluation container: Feature examples\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use the Nova evaluation container to evaluate large language models. You'll work through a support ticket classification example that demonstrates key features for production model evaluation.\n",
    "|\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers four main areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Metadata passthrough**: Keep custom fields (like difficulty level, domain, priority) with your data during evaluation. This lets you see how your model performs on different types of inputs without extra data processing.\n",
    "- **BYOM (Bring your own metrics)**: Use Lambda functions to validate outputs against your specific requirements. Instead of just checking accuracy, you can verify JSON formatting, business rules, and domain-specific constraints.\n",
    "- **Confidence & Failure Analysis with logprobs**: Extract token-level probabilities to understand when your model is uncertain. This helps identify overconfident predictions and calibration issues.\n",
    "- **Multi-Node evalutaion**: Run evaluations across multiple instances to handle large datasets efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Example\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll evaluate a support ticket classifier using 40 examples with different categories, difficulty levels, and business domains. The notebook shows how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up custom Lambda functions for validation\n",
    "- Configure evaluation recipes with log probabilities\n",
    "- Launch distributed evaluation jobs on SageMaker\n",
    "- Analyze results to find specific failure patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll understand how to move beyond simple accuracy scores to get detailed insights about where and why your model fails. This approach helps you make \n",
    "targeted improvements rather than guessing what needs to be fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques work for any text classification task, but the principles apply to other model types as well."

    "\n",
    "Standard evaluation gives you overall metrics like 95% accuracy. This doesn't show performance differences across customer types, product categories, or other important dimensions.Without metadata passthrough, you need separate tracking systems and complex data joins after evaluation. This creates extra work and potential data consistency issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "With metadata passthrough, you can see performance breakdowns immediately. For example, you might find 98% accuracy on billing queries but 60% accuracy on technical support cases.This detailed view helps identify specific problems. You can see patterns like \"the model fails on complex logistics cases\" or \"confidence scores are unreliable for legalcompliance queries.\" This makes it easier to focus improvements on the right areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata passthrough shows you not just whether your model works, but where it works well and where it doesn't. Here we take advantage of this feature to pass metadata fields `category`, `difficulty`, `domain`, and  `priority`"

    "## Custom Metrics with BYOM Workflow\n",

    "Without custom metrics, you evaluate models in two separate steps: check general performance, then validate production requirements. This creates a gap where models pass evaluation but fail in production due to format errors or business rule violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bring-your-own-metrics (BYOM) puts your production validation logic into the evaluation pipeline. Instead of relying on accuracy scores alone, you can check that responses follow JSON schemas, meet business constraints, and handle edge cases correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps because production failures often come from format issues, not content problems. A model might generate accurate responses that break JSON parsing or miss required fields. Custom metrics catch these problems during evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit is alignment between evaluation and production. Your evaluation metrics match your production validation logic, so test results better predict real-world performance. BYOM help ensure your model works correctly in your actual system, not just on academic benchmarks."

    "## Failure Analysis with Log Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "This section implements confidence analysis with raw model prediction logits into actionable insights. We examine the relationship between model confidence and prediction quality to identify failure patterns that could compromise model trustworthiness. For our classifcation use case we can simply look at the first token of the classification string as our classes do not all start with the same tokens. This eliminates the complexity of combining tokens and probabilities then calculating a mean to be used in downstream scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Confidence extraction**: Convert prediction logits into confidence scores\n",
    "- **Failure detection**: Identify overconfident or uncertain predictions  \n",
    "- **Visualization**: Create charts to show model reliability patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logit processing**: Parse prediction data and handle different formats\n",
    "- **Token analysis**: Extract prediction tokens and calculate probabilities\n",
    "- **Failure classification**: Find low-confidence predictions and overconfident errors\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis shows:\n",
    "- How to extract confidence metrics from model outputs\n",
    "- Which patterns indicate model failures\n",
    "- How to visualize confidence data\n",

Before we can analyze confidence patterns, we need to extract the actual predictions and probability scores from these varied formats.\n",

    "Our parsing functions handle three main tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Format Conversion**: Transform JSON strings, Python literals, and nested arrays into consistent structures for analysis.\n",
    "- **Information Extraction**: Pull class predictions, confidence scores, and metadata from evaluation results.\n",
    "- **Error Recovery**: Deal with malformed data, missing fields, and parsing failures that happen in real evaluation pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "What looks like simple parsing actually solves a practical problem: evaluation systems rarely produce data in the same format twice. Different models, frameworks, and even individual predictions can generate outputs in completely different structures. Our functions need to handle this variation while extracting consistent data for analysis."

Poor calibration indicates overconfident predictions on incorrect outputs, suggesting need for confidence penalty training or temperature scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Domain-Specific Performance Patterns**: Different domains (IT support, billing, security) exhibit varying complexity levels and linguistic patterns. Performance gaps across domains indicate training data imbalances or domain-specific feature requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty-Accuracy Relationships**: The relationship between labeled difficulty and model performance reveals whether the model struggles with inherently complex cases or exhibits systematic biases independent of true difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metadata Cross-Tabulation**: Examining performance at metadata intersections (e.g., hard IT support tickets vs. easy billing queries) identifies compound failure modes where multiple factors interact to degrade performance."

This systematic stratified analysis framework dissects model behavior across metadata dimensions, revealing interaction effects and failure modes invisible to traditional evaluation approaches.\n",

    "This multi-dimensional approach transforms evaluation from reactive performance measurement into proactive failure mode detection, enabling precise, targeted model improvements rather than broad optimization efforts. By systematically examining confidence-accuracy relationships across domain, difficulty, and category intersections, teams can identify exactly where models fail and why, converting scattered performance issues into structured improvement roadmaps.\n",

    "The framework addresses three critical evaluation limitations: **calibration assessment** across heterogeneous data segments, **interaction effect detection** between model confidence and task characteristics, and **intervention prioritization** based on failure severity and statistical significance.

    "**Metadata Passthrough**: End-to-end preservation of custom fields enables stratified analysis across domains, difficulty levels, and categories without post-hoc data joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Log Probabilities**: Token-level uncertainty quantification supports confidence calibration, quality gates, and hallucination detection in production systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom Metrics (BYOM)**: Complete evaluation pipeline control with schema validation, domain-specific metrics, and flexible pre/post-processing hooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Node Scaling**: Distributed evaluation maintains deterministic results while scaling from thousands to millions of examples through simple replica configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data into Action**\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-dimensional analysis approach—combining confidence calibration assessment, cross-tabulation interaction detection, and problematic segment identification—converts scattered performance issues into structured improvement roadmaps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision Targeting**: Identify exactly which domain-difficulty combinations require intervention\n",
    "- **Resource Optimization**: Prioritize improvements based on failure severity and statistical significance\n",
    "- **Risk Assessment**: Detect overconfident predictions that pose production reliability risks\n",
    "- **Systematic Improvement**: Transform reactive debugging into proactive optimization planning\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deploy Evaluation Pipeline**: Configure your dataset and custom metrics using the Nova Container framework\n",
    "2. **Implement Stratified Analysis**: Apply confidence-metadata segmentation to identify hidden failure modes\n",
    "3. **Establish Production Monitoring**: Track calibration quality across metadata dimensions in live systems\n",
    "4. **Scale Systematically**: Use multi-node configuration for comprehensive dataset evaluation\n",
    "5. **Optimize Strategically**: Focus interventions on problematic segments with maximum impact potential\\n\n"
